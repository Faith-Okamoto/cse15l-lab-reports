- My family has two pets. In order of size:
  1. Snowball/Snowy, a Bichon mix. Small white dog, but larger than...
  2. Diana, a large black rabbit.

## What I'm doing right now, coding-wise.

I have a job at an on-campus lab. Currently they have me fiddling with a Shiny app. It uses R to create HTML. I knew the `ggplot2` package in R but I've had to learn new functions such as `dbGetQuery` and `renderUI`. There are a truly frightening number of packages used which I'm fairly unfamiliar with. See the top of the file:

```
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
library(shinyjs)
library(DT)
library(RPostgres)
library(shinyWidgets)
library(shinymanager)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(scrypt)
library(DBI)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)
library(rjson)
library(ggpubr)
library(lares)
```
